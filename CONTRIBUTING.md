# Contributing to Website Redesign

This is an adapted version of the contributing guide used by the Community Committee: https://github.com/nodejs/community-committee/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md

## Vocabulary

* A **Contributor** is any individual creating or commenting on an issue or pull request,
  or contributing in some other way.
* A **Collaborator** is a contributor who has been given write access to the repository.

## Contributing Documentation and Getting Started Guides

While the Website Redesign working group continues to iterate on site design and content structure, we will use an RFC process to accept and evaluate Node.js documentation and guide proposals in this repo. All proposed documentation pages and instructions for the RFC process can be found in the [/documentation](./documentation) directory.

## All Other Contributions

Any change to resources in this repository must be through pull requests. This applies to all changes to documentation, code, binary files, etc. No pull request can be merged without being reviewed.

The default for each contribution is that it is accepted once no collaborator has an objection. During review collaborators may also request that a specific contributor who is most versed in a particular area gives a "LGTM" before the PR can be merged. There is no additional "sign off" process for contributions to land. Once all issues brought by collaborators are addressed it can be landed by any collaborator.

In the case of an objection being raised in a pull request by another collaborator, all involved collaborators should seek to arrive at a consensus by way of addressing concerns being expressed by discussion, compromise on the proposed change, or withdrawal of the proposed change.
