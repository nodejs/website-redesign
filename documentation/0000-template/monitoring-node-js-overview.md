# Monitoring Node.js â€“ Overview

When you're deploying a Node.js application to production, you're likely going to want to monitor it for non-typical behavior. Whether you're monitoring CPU usage, heap usage, garbage collection, asynchronous activity, or any of the other key metrics for Node.js applications, you're going to need to implement additional monitoring tooling to actually get the information you need.

## What is contained within?

In our monitoring guides, authors will show readers how to effectively use different tooling that can enable readers to effectively monitor their applications.

### Key Terminology
There is some key terminology you'll want to know before digging into our guides. 

* **CPU usage:** How much CPU is being used by your Node.js process.
* **Heap usage:** How much heap (memory) is being used by your Node.js process.
* **Garbage Collection (GC):** Automatic memory management, clearing old and unused memory.
<!-- Don't hesitate to PR more terms if you feel the need / think there are some missing! -->

If there's a term that's referenced but not defined, please don't hesitate to open a PR against this article's source to start the process of adding it (even if you don't know the exact definition!)

## What's next?
Monitoring Node.js in production is often an essential task for teams that have code that needs to be performant without issue. Monitoring tooling can help with that, but isn't always _obvious_ how to set up. Hopefully our Monitoring guides can help you get set up with effective monitoring tooling.
