# Using Node.js with frontend frameworks
> This module is about using React, a frontend framework with Node.js on a Linux environment using terminal.


## Node.js + React.js
> We will be creating a simple Hello-World app using React because what better way to learn than by doing?


### Requirements:
  - Node.js
  - React.js
  - NPM (package manager)


#### Node.js:
Be sure to have Node.js before starting. You can visit https://nodejs.org/en/download/ if you need instructions on downloading Node.


#### React.js
We will use this framework to create our user interface. We highly encourage visiting https://reactjs.org/ for the complete and official documentation and tutorial.



## Step 1:
> To start, We will need to setup our React.js application. The easiest way to this is by using the create-react-app command which bundles all the tools you may need for development. Alternatively, you can start building the application by installing the required tools and packages individually. You may want to read the official React.js documentation for this process but for this tutorial, we will be utilizing the create-react-app command.

> We will continue by using NPM to install CRA(create-react-app).

> >npm install create-react-app -g

> Here, we are issuing the "npm" command to install "create-react-app" and the additional flag "-g" is specifying to install "create-react-app" globally. In this sense, we can freely issue the command to create React.js application on any directory in you machine without having to install the package all over again for each project you create.

## Step 2:
> Next step is the creation of the project. you want to navigate through the directory where you want to create your project.

> After navigating to the directory of your choice, then you can issue the command

>>create-react-app hello-world

> In the command, you are basically creating a new React project with the name "hello-world"

> Once done, you should receive a confirmation like:

> > Success! Created hello-world at <your directory>/hello-world
Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

  >>npm start
    Starts the development server.

  >>npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

  >>npm test
    Starts the test runner.

  >>npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

>>We suggest that you begin by typing:

  >>cd hello-world
  >>npm start

>>Happy hacking!


## Step 3:
>At this point, we have our React app created in the current directory. All we have to to do is to go in the directory and start the app.

>>We can accomplish this by issuing the following comands:

>>cd hello-world

>>npm start

>The application will open a new window and launch the app.

>Alternatively, you can access the app on your localhost and on the default port 3000.

>>http://localhost:3000/

#### Finally:
>Open the application on your favorite editor or IDE and edit the file App.js located in src directory.

>> hello-world/src/App.js

>and to formally end this tutorial, replace the Header 1 with "Hello world" and save.

>Proceed to your app to see the changes.




## Conclusion

> To Summarize things up, we created our React app using the create-react-app command on a terminal. This package can be installed via NPM.

> The create-react-app creates an app with some packages useful for development.
