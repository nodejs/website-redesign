This is the organizational repository for the Node.js Website Redesign Strategic

initiative is tasked with organizing and facilitating the redesign of the
https://nodejs.org website, and keeping track of cross-cutting concerns with
other groups such as the Internationalization WG.

## Governance

This initiative adopts the general Node.js [Code of Conduct][], as well as its
own [Contributing Guidelines][].
